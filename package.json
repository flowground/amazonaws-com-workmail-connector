    "description": "Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with\nsupport for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your\nemail, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or their\nnative iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail\nwith your existing corporate directory and control both the keys that encrypt\nyour data and the location in which your data is stored.\n\nThe Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:\n\n *  Listing and describing organizations\n   \n   \n\n *  Managing users\n   \n   \n\n *  Managing groups\n   \n   \n\n *  Managing resources\n   \n   \n\nAll Amazon WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed.\nThey not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive\nuse of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission\npolicies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon\nWorkMail site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire\nAmazon WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but\nis not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and\nresources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well\nas give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM\nmodel.",
